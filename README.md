# Feature-Selection-and-Cancer-Detection


In this project, I leveraged feature selection techniques to extract the most relevant features and then applied machine learning models to detect cancers from the datasets. List below are the machine learning models I utilized in the project:

-  Logistic Regression
-  AdaBoost
-  Decision Trees
-  Random Forest
-  Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
-  Naive Bayes
-  K-means Clustering

## Sample Result:

The Figure below illustrates how I could distinguish between three types of classes:
